## Short Search 

Simple chrome extension to define aliases to certain links. Just use the the extension popup to create aliases (or _cmds_ as they are in the extension) and use the keyword **ss** to trigger the extension in the search bar

> I just got overwhelmed with the number of bookmarks that I had and it came to a point where I felt navigating to the actual site would be simpler. Hence made this tool to help with my troubles

### Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps

1. Clone the repository in the directory of your choice using: `git clone `
2. Open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Navigate to where you cloned the repo and open the `dist` directory. 
4. drag abd drop the `.crx` file into the  `chrome://extensions/` page

To use the extension click on the extension icon (_For now it is just the letter S_) in the available extensions. Clicking on the icon should open a popup where you can add and delete aliases that you have made.
